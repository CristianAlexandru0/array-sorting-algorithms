# Sorting Algorithm for Integer Arrays

We implement 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays.

## Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.

## Merge Sort

The Merge Sort algorithm is a Divide and Conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them.

The algorithm is implemented in C.

## Radix Sort

The Radix Sort algorithm is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts integers by processing individual digits.

The algorithm is implemented in C.
